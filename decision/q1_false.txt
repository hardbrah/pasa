Title: Scaling Vision-Language Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts
Abstract:  Abstract The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the development of large-scale vision-language models (VLMs). These models aim to bridge the gap between text and visual information, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of multimedia data. However, as these models become larger and more complex, they also become more challenging to train and deploy. One approach to addressing this challenge is the use of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques, which divide the model into smaller, specialized sub-models that can jointly solve a task. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost. Our research offers valuable insights into stabilizing the training of MoE models, understanding the impact of MoE on model interpretability, and balancing the trade-offs between compute performance when scaling VLMs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the use of MoE for scaling large-scale vision-language models and other multimodal machine learning applications. ∗{*} equal contribution; §§\S work initiated during an internship at Microsoft. 
GPT Response:
**Decision:** False  
**Reason:** While the paper discusses scaling vision-language models (VLMs) using sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques and explores multimodal machine learning applications, it does not explicitly focus on multi-source learning, which involves leveraging data from diverse sources to improve the learning process and model performance. The paper primarily addresses model scaling, computational efficiency, and interpretability in the context of vision-language tasks, rather than the integration of diverse data sources to enhance learning. Therefore, it does not fully satisfy the requirements of the user query.

Title: Uni-Perceiver-MoE: Learning Sparse Generalist Models with Conditional MoEs
Abstract:  Abstract To build an artificial neural network like the biological intelligence system, recent works have unified numerous tasks into a generalist model, which can process various tasks with shared parameters and do not have any task-specific modules. While generalist models achieve promising results on various benchmarks, they have performance degradation on some tasks compared with task-specialized models. In this work, we find that interference among different tasks and modalities is the main factor to this phenomenon. To mitigate such interference, we introduce the Conditional Mixture-of-Experts (Conditional MoEs) to generalist models. Routing strategies under different levels of conditions are proposed to take both the training/inference cost and generalization ability into account. By incorporating the proposed Conditional MoEs, the recently proposed generalist model Uni-Perceiver can effectively mitigate the interference across tasks and modalities, and achieves state-of-the-art results on a series of downstream tasks via prompt tuning on 1% of downstream data. Moreover, the introduction of Conditional MoEs still holds the generalization ability of generalist models to conduct zero-shot inference on new tasks, e.g., video-text retrieval and video caption. Code and pre-trained generalist models shall be released at https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Uni-Perceiver. 
GPT Response:
**Decision:** False  
**Reason:** While the paper "Uni-Perceiver-MoE: Learning Sparse Generalist Models with Conditional MoEs" discusses the use of Conditional Mixture-of-Experts (Conditional MoEs) to improve the performance of generalist models across various tasks and modalities, it does not explicitly focus on multi-source learning as described in the user query. The user query specifically asks for works that use data from diverse sources to improve the learning process and model performance. The paper primarily addresses task and modality interference within a unified generalist model framework and proposes methods to mitigate this interference. Although it mentions handling multiple tasks and modalities, it does not explicitly focus on leveraging diverse data sources in the context of multi-source learning. Therefore, the paper does not fully satisfy the detailed requirements of the user query.

Title: Lightweight In-Context Tuning for Multimodal Unified Models
Abstract:  Abstract In-context learning (ICL) involves reasoning from given contextual examples. As more modalities comes, this procedure is becoming more challenging as the interleaved input modalities convolutes the understanding process. This is exemplified by the observation that multimodal models often struggle to effectively extrapolate from contextual examples to perform ICL. To address these challenges, we introduce MultiModal In-conteXt Tuning (M2IXT), a lightweight module to enhance the ICL capabilities of multimodal unified models. The proposed M2IXT module perceives an expandable context window to incorporate various labeled examples of multiple modalities (e.g., text, image, and coordinates). It can be prepended to various multimodal unified models (e.g., OFA, Unival, LLaVA) of different architectures and trained via a mixed-tasks strategy to enable rapid few-shot adaption on multiple tasks and datasets. When tuned on as little as 50K multimodal data, M2IXT can boost the few-shot ICL performance significantly (e.g., 18% relative increase for OFA), and obtained state-of-the-art results across an array of tasks including visual question answering, image captioning, visual grounding, and visual entailment, while being considerably small in terms of model parameters (e.g., ∼similar-to\sim20×20\times smaller than Flamingo or MMICL), highlighting the flexibility and effectiveness of M2IXT as a multimodal in-context learner. 
GPT Response:
**Decision:** False  
**Reason:** While the paper discusses a method (M2IXT) for enhancing multimodal in-context learning by utilizing data from multiple modalities (e.g., text, image, coordinates), it primarily focuses on improving the in-context learning capabilities of multimodal unified models. The emphasis is on adapting models to perform few-shot learning across tasks and datasets through a lightweight tuning module. However, the user query specifically seeks research on **multi-source learning** that leverages **data from diverse sources** to improve the learning process and model performance. Multi-source learning typically involves integrating and learning from distinct datasets or sources to enhance model training and performance. The paper does not explicitly address multi-source learning in the sense of combining or learning from diverse data sources but rather focuses on improving multimodal models' ability to handle interleaved input modalities in a few-shot context. Therefore, the paper does not fully satisfy the user's query.

Title: CaMML: Context-Aware Multimodal Learner for Large Models
Abstract:  Abstract In this work, we introduce Context-Aware MultiModal Learner (CaMML), for tuning large multimodal models (LMMs). CaMML, a lightweight module, is crafted to seamlessly integrate multimodal contextual samples into large models, thereby empowering the model to derive knowledge from analogous, domain-specific, up-to-date information and make grounded inferences. Importantly, CaMML is highly scalable and can efficiently handle lengthy multimodal context examples owing to its hierarchical design. Based on CaMML, we have developed two multimodal models, CaMML-7B and CaMML-13B, that have shown exceptional performance across an array of benchmark datasets for multimodal tasks. Remarkably, CaMML-13B achieves the state-of-the-art performance on over ten widely recognized multimodal benchmark datasets, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 (13B) with a noticeable margin, without integration of any external resources. Moreover, we have conducted extensive ablative studies to inspect the inner workings of CaMML and performed qualitative analyses to showcase its effectiveness in handling real-world challenging cases. 
GPT Response:
**Decision:** False  
**Reason:** The paper titled "CaMML: Context-Aware Multimodal Learner for Large Models" does not fully satisfy the detailed requirements of the user query. While the paper focuses on multimodal learning and the integration of contextual samples into large models, it does not explicitly address "multi-source learning" as described in the query. Multi-source learning typically involves leveraging data from diverse and distinct sources to improve the learning process and model performance. The abstract of the paper primarily discusses the use of multimodal contextual samples and hierarchical design for scalability, but it does not explicitly mention or emphasize the use of data from diverse sources or how such data is combined to enhance learning. Therefore, the paper does not fully align with the user's query.

Title: Mod-Squad: Designing Mixture of Experts As Modular Multi-Task Learners
Abstract:  Abstract Optimization in multi-task learning (MTL) is more challenging than single-task learning (STL), as the gradient from different tasks can be contradictory. When tasks are related, it can be beneficial to share some parameters among them (cooperation). However, some tasks require additional parameters with expertise in a specific type of data or discrimination (specialization). To address the MTL challenge, we propose Mod-Squad, a new model that is Modularized into groups of experts (a ‘Squad’). This structure allows us to formalize cooperation and specialization as the process of matching experts and tasks. We optimize this matching process during the training of a single model. Specifically, we incorporate mixture of experts (MoE) layers into a transformer model, with a new loss that incorporates the mutual dependence between tasks and experts. As a result, only a small set of experts are activated for each task. This prevents the sharing of the entire backbone model between all tasks, which strengthens the model, especially when the training set size and the number of tasks scale up. More interestingly, for each task, we can extract the small set of experts as a standalone model that maintains the same performance as the large model. Extensive experiments on the Taskonomy dataset with 13 vision tasks and the PASCAL-Context dataset with 5 vision tasks show the superiority of our approach. 
GPT Response:
**Decision:** False  
**Reason:** The paper "Mod-Squad: Designing Mixture of Experts As Modular Multi-Task Learners" focuses on multi-task learning (MTL), where the goal is to optimize the learning process across multiple related tasks by using a modularized mixture of experts approach. While it does involve learning from multiple tasks, the paper does not explicitly address **multi-source learning**, which refers to learning from **diverse data sources** (e.g., data from different domains, modalities, or distributions). The abstract emphasizes task cooperation and specialization, but it does not mention the integration or utilization of data from diverse sources to improve the learning process or model performance. Therefore, the paper does not fully satisfy the user's query.

Title: Heterogeneous Multi-task Learning with Expert Diversity
Abstract:  Abstract Predicting multiple heterogeneous biological and medical targets is a challenge for traditional deep learning models. In contrast to single-task learning, in which a separate model is trained for each target, multi-task learning (MTL) optimizes a single model to predict multiple related targets simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose the Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts with Exclusivity (MMoEEx). Our work aims to tackle the heterogeneous MTL setting, in which the same model optimizes multiple tasks with different characteristics. Such a scenario can overwhelm current MTL approaches due to the challenges in balancing shared and task-specific representations and the need to optimize tasks with competing optimization paths. Our method makes two key contributions: first, we introduce an approach to induce more diversity among experts, thus creating representations more suitable for highly imbalanced and heterogenous MTL learning; second, we adopt a two-step optimization [1, 2] approach to balancing the tasks at the gradient level. We validate our method on three MTL benchmark datasets, including UCI-Census-income dataset, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and PubChem BioAssay (PCBA). 
GPT Response:
**Decision:** False  
**Reason:** The searched paper focuses on heterogeneous multi-task learning (MTL), where a single model is optimized to predict multiple related tasks simultaneously. While the paper addresses challenges related to balancing shared and task-specific representations and optimizing tasks with competing objectives, it does not explicitly focus on multi-source learning, which involves leveraging data from diverse sources to improve the learning process and model performance. Instead, the paper deals with optimizing tasks with different characteristics within a single dataset or framework, rather than integrating or learning from multiple distinct data sources. Therefore, it does not fully satisfy the user's query about multi-source learning.

Title: M3ViT: Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformer for Efficient Multi-task Learning with Model-Accelerator Co-design
Abstract:  Abstract Multi-task learning (MTL) encapsulates multiple learned tasks in a single model and often lets those tasks learn better jointly. However, when deploying MTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or latency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training, simultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient conflicts across tasks, and the challenge is amplified when a growing number of tasks have to be squeezed into one compact model; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate nearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real systems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, and switch between tasks as needed: therefore such “all tasks activated” inference is also highly inefficient and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL, that tackles both training and inference bottlenecks. Our framework, dubbed M3ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training, which effectively disentangles the parameter spaces to avoid different tasks’ training conflicts. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows for activating only the task-corresponding sparse “expert” pathway, instead of the full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level innovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for memory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and can scale to any number of experts. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-Context [1] and NYUD-v2 [2] datasets at both software and hardware levels are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design. When executing single-task inference, M3ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while significantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware platform of one Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, our co-design framework reduces the memory requirement by 2.40×\times, while achieving energy efficiency up to 9.23×\times higher than a comparable FPGA baseline. Code is available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/M3ViT. 
GPT Response:
**Decision:** False  
**Reason:** The paper "M3ViT: Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformer for Efficient Multi-task Learning with Model-Accelerator Co-design" focuses on multi-task learning (MTL) rather than multi-source learning. While MTL involves learning multiple tasks within a single model, it does not necessarily imply the use of data from diverse sources. The paper primarily addresses challenges in optimizing multiple tasks and improving efficiency during training and inference, particularly in resource-constrained environments. It does not explicitly discuss or utilize data from diverse sources to improve the learning process or model performance, which is the key requirement of the user query. Therefore, the paper does not fully satisfy the query's requirements.

Title: Cross-lingual Language Model Pretraining
Abstract:  Abstract Recent studies have demonstrated the efficiency of generative pretraining for English natural language understanding. In this work, we extend this approach to multiple languages and show the effectiveness of cross-lingual pretraining. We propose two methods to learn cross-lingual language models (XLMs): one unsupervised that only relies on monolingual data, and one supervised that leverages parallel data with a new cross-lingual language model objective. We obtain state-of-the-art results on cross-lingual classification, unsupervised and supervised machine translation. On XNLI, our approach pushes the state of the art by an absolute gain of 4.9% accuracy. On unsupervised machine translation, we obtain 34.3 BLEU on WMT’16 German-English, improving the previous state of the art by more than 9 BLEU. On supervised machine translation, we obtain a new state of the art of 38.5 BLEU on WMT’16 Romanian-English, outperforming the previous best approach by more than 4 BLEU. Our code and pretrained models will be made publicly available. 
GPT Response:
**Decision:** False  
**Reason:** The paper titled "Cross-lingual Language Model Pretraining" focuses on pretraining cross-lingual language models (XLMs) using monolingual data (unsupervised) and parallel data (supervised) to improve performance on tasks like cross-lingual classification and machine translation. While it demonstrates the use of data from diverse languages, its primary focus is on cross-lingual transfer and language model pretraining rather than explicitly addressing multi-source learning as described in the user query. The user query specifically seeks works that use data from diverse sources (not necessarily limited to languages) to improve the learning process and model performance. This paper does not explicitly explore or discuss multi-source learning in the broader sense of combining data from diverse sources (e.g., modalities, domains, or tasks) beyond linguistic diversity. Therefore, it does not fully satisfy the detailed requirements of the user query.

Despite some recent advances addressing each of the two problems separately, no results have been reported that have theoretical guarantees on both privacy protection and saddle/maximum avoidance in decentralized nonconvex optimization. We propose a new algorithm for decentralized nonconvex optimization that can enable both rigorous differential privacy and saddle/maximum avoiding performance. The new algorithm allows the incorporation of persistent additive noise to enable rigorous differential privacy for data samples, gradients, and intermediate optimization variables without losing provable convergence, and thus circumventing the dilemma of trading accuracy for privacy in differential privacy design. More interestingly, the algorithm is theoretically proven to be able to efficiently  guarantee accuracy by avoiding convergence to local maxima and saddle points, which has not been reported before in the literature on decentralized nonconvex optimization. The algorithm is efficient in both communication (it only shares one variable in each iteration) and computation (it is encryption-free), and hence is promising for large-scale nonconvex optimization and learning involving high-dimensional optimization parameters.
