Title: Muppet: Massive Multi-task Representations with Pre-Finetuning
Abstract:  Abstract We propose pre-finetuning, an additional large-scale learning stage between language model pre-training and fine-tuning. Pre-finetuning is massively multi-task learning (around 50 datasets, over 4.8 million total labeled examples), and is designed to encourage learning of representations that generalize better to many different tasks. We show that pre-finetuning consistently improves performance for pretrained discriminators (e.g. RoBERTa) and generation models (e.g. BART) on a wide range of tasks (sentence prediction, commonsense reasoning, MRC, etc.), while also significantly improving sample efficiency during fine-tuning. We also show that large-scale multi-tasking is crucial; pre-finetuning can hurt performance when few tasks are used up until a critical point (usually above 15) after which performance improves linearly in the number of tasks.

**Decision:** True  
**Reason:** The paper "Muppet: Massive Multi-task Representations with Pre-Finetuning" satisfies the user query as it focuses on multi-source learning by leveraging data from diverse sources (around 50 datasets with over 4.8 million labeled examples) to improve the learning process and model performance. The proposed "pre-finetuning" stage involves massively multi-task learning, which explicitly uses data from various sources to generalize better across different tasks. This aligns with the user's interest in works that use data from diverse sources to enhance the learning process and model performance.

Title: MultiMAE: Multi-modal Multi-task Masked Autoencoders
Abstract:  Abstract We propose a pre-training strategy called Multi-modal Multi-task Masked Autoencoders (MultiMAE). It differs from standard Masked Autoencoding in two key aspects: I) it can optionally accept additional modalities of information in the input besides the RGB image (hence “multi-modal”), and II) its training objective accordingly includes predicting multiple outputs besides the RGB image (hence “multi-task”). We make use of masking (across image patches and input modalities) to make training MultiMAE tractable as well as to ensure cross-modality predictive coding is indeed learned by the network. We show this pre-training strategy leads to a flexible, simple, and efficient framework with improved transfer results to downstream tasks. In particular, the same exact pre-trained network can be flexibly used when additional information besides RGB images is available or when no information other than RGB is available – in all configurations yielding competitive to or significantly better results than the baselines. To avoid needing training datasets with multiple modalities and tasks, we train MultiMAE entirely using pseudo labeling, which makes the framework widely applicable to any RGB dataset. The experiments are performed on multiple transfer tasks (image classification, semantic segmentation, depth estimation) and datasets (ImageNet, ADE20K, Taskonomy, Hypersim, NYUv2). The results show an intriguingly impressive capability by the model in cross-modal/task predictive coding and transfer. Code, pre-trained models, and interactive visualizations are available at https://multimae.epfl.ch. 
GPT Response:
**Decision:** True  
**Reason:** The paper "MultiMAE: Multi-modal Multi-task Masked Autoencoders" satisfies the requirements of the user query. The user is looking for works on multi-source learning that utilize data from diverse sources to improve the learning process and model performance. The paper explicitly addresses this by proposing a framework (MultiMAE) that incorporates multiple modalities of input data (e.g., RGB images and additional modalities) and multiple tasks (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, depth estimation). This approach leverages diverse data sources to enhance the model's learning process and performance. The use of masking across image patches and input modalities ensures that the network learns cross-modality predictive coding, which aligns with the concept of improving learning through diverse data sources. Additionally, the experiments demonstrate improved transfer results to downstream tasks, further supporting the claim that the method enhances model performance.

In this paper, we study two algorithms for this purpose, i.e., DP-SGD and DP-NSGD, which first clip or normalize per-sample gradients to bound the sensitivity and then add noise to obfuscate the exact information. We analyze the convergence behavior of these two algorithms in the non-convex optimization setting with two common assumptions and achieve a rate 𝒪​(d​log⁡(1/δ)N2​ϵ24)𝒪4𝑑1𝛿superscript𝑁2superscriptitalic-ϵ2\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt[4]{\\frac{d\\log(1/\\delta)}{N^{2}\\epsilon^{2}}}\\right) of the gradient norm for a d𝑑d-dimensional model, N𝑁N samples and (ϵ,δ)italic-ϵ𝛿(\\epsilon,\\delta)-DP, which improves over previous bounds under much weaker assumptions. Specifically, we introduce a regularizing factor in DP-NSGD and show that it is crucial in the convergence proof and subtly controls the bias and noise trade-off. Our proof deliberately handles the per-sample gradient clipping and normalization that are specified for the private setting. Empirically, we demonstrate that these two algorithms achieve similar best accuracy while DP-NSGD is comparatively easier to tune than DP-SGD and hence may help further save the privacy budget when accounting the tuning effort.
